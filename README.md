This project is configured for a consistent development environment using VS Code Dev Containers and GitHub Codespaces.

---

## Installation

You can set up this project in two ways: using the provided Dev Container (recommended) or setting it up manually on your local machine.

### Option 1: Using Dev Containers or GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

This is the easiest and most reliable way to get started. It ensures you have the exact same environment as the project maintainers.

1.  **GitHub Codespaces**:
    *   Click the **Code** button on the repository page.
    *   Select the **Codespaces** tab.
    *   Click **Create codespace on main**. This will launch a fully configured environment in your browser.

2.  **VS Code Dev Containers (Local)**:
    *   Ensure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
    *   Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) in VS Code.
    *   Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/ai.git`
    *   Open the cloned repository folder in VS Code.
    *   A notification will appear asking if you want to "Reopen in Container". Click it. VS Code will build the container and set up your environment automatically.

### Option 2: Manual Local Setup

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can set up the project locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/ai.git
    cd ai
    ```

2.  **Create a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows (PowerShell/CMD):**
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the main application.

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated** (if using manual setup).

2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

[**Add more specific usage instructions here.**]

For example:
*   If it's a web app: "After running the command, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`."
*   If it's a command-line tool: "You can provide arguments to the script like so: `python app.py --input 'path/to/data.csv' --output 'results.json'`."
*   Explain what the expected output is.

# AI Project Template

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A foundational repository for a modern AI application, complete with a development environment powered by VS Code Dev Containers.

## Description

[**Replace this section with a detailed description of your project.**]

This project is a lightweight Python application designed to [**describe the main goal, e.g., "serve a machine learning model via a REST API," "demonstrate a specific AI algorithm," or "provide a simple chatbot interface."**].

It's built to be easily set up and run, thanks to its dependency management with `requirements.txt` and a pre-configured development container for a consistent and reproducible environment.

### Features
*   **Main Application (`app.py`):** The core logic of the AI application.
*   **Dependency Management (`requirements.txt`):** Clearly defined Python package dependencies.
*   **Dev Container Support (`.devcontainer`):** Allows for one-click setup of a complete development environment using Docker and VS Code.

---

## Installation

You can set up this project in two ways: using the recommended VS Code Dev Container or by setting up a manual Python environment.

### 1. Recommended: Using VS Code Dev Containers

This is the easiest and most reliable way to get started. It ensures your development environment is identical to the one intended for the project.

**Prerequisites:**
*   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
*   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
*   [VS Code Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

**Steps:**
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/ai.git
    cd ai
    ```
2.  Open the project folder in VS Code.
3.  A notification will appear at the bottom-right corner asking to "Reopen in Container". Click it.
4.  VS Code will build the Docker container based on the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` configuration. This will automatically install Python, all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and any specified VS Code extensions.

You are now ready to run the application!

### 2. Manual Setup: Using a Virtual Environment

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can set up a local Python environment.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.8+
*   pip

**Steps:**
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/ai.git
    cd ai
    ```
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:

    *   **macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
---

## Usage

Once the installation is complete (either via Dev Container or manually), you can run the application.

1.  From your terminal (inside the Dev Container or your activated virtual environment), execute the main application file:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  The application will start a local server, typically available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3.  [**Add specific instructions here. For example: "Open your web browser to the address above to interact with the UI," or "You can now send POST requests to the `/predict` endpoint using an API client like Postman or curl."**]
