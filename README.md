A brief, one-sentence description of what this AI project does.

## Description

<!-- Provide a more detailed description of your project. -->
<!-- What problem does it solve? What are the key features? -->
<!-- For example: -->
This repository contains a Python application designed to [e.g., perform sentiment analysis on user-provided text, generate images from prompts, classify data from a CSV file]. It is built using [mention key libraries from requirements.txt, e.g., PyTorch, Transformers, Flask, etc.] and is configured for a seamless development experience using VS Code Dev Containers and GitHub Codespaces.

The project structure includes:
- `app.py`: The main entry point for the application.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of all Python dependencies.
- `.devcontainer/`: Configuration for a consistent, containerized development environment.

## Installation

There are two recommended ways to set up this project: using a Dev Container (recommended) or setting up a local environment manually.

### 1. Recommended: Using Dev Containers or GitHub Codespaces

This is the easiest and most reliable way to get started. This method uses the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to create a fully configured development environment with all dependencies and tools pre-installed.

- **GitHub Codespaces**: Click the "Code" button on the repository page and select "Open with Codespaces". A new environment will be created for you in the cloud.
- **VS Code Dev Containers**:
  1. Make sure you have Docker and the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed in VS Code.
  2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai.git`
  3. Open the repository folder in VS Code.
  4. A pop-up will appear asking you to "Reopen in Container". Click it to build and launch the dev container.

### 2. Manual Local Setup

If you prefer to set up the environment on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai.git
    cd ai
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Unix/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application.

```bash
python app.py
```

<!-- Add more specific instructions here. For example: -->
<!-- 
**If it's a command-line tool:**
python app.py --input "some text" --model "my-model"

**If it's a web application (e.g., Flask or Streamlit):**
The application will start a local server. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to use the interface.
