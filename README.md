This project is configured for a consistent development environment using VS Code Dev Containers and GitHub Codespaces.

---

## Installation

You can set up this project in two ways: using the provided Dev Container (recommended) or setting it up manually on your local machine.

### Option 1: Using Dev Containers or GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

This is the easiest and most reliable way to get started. It ensures you have the exact same environment as the project maintainers.

1.  **GitHub Codespaces**:
    *   Click the **Code** button on the repository page.
    *   Select the **Codespaces** tab.
    *   Click **Create codespace on main**. This will launch a fully configured environment in your browser.

2.  **VS Code Dev Containers (Local)**:
    *   Ensure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
    *   Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) in VS Code.
    *   Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/ai.git`
    *   Open the cloned repository folder in VS Code.
    *   A notification will appear asking if you want to "Reopen in Container". Click it. VS Code will build the container and set up your environment automatically.

### Option 2: Manual Local Setup

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can set up the project locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/ai.git
    cd ai
    ```

2.  **Create a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows (PowerShell/CMD):**
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the main application.

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated** (if using manual setup).

2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

[**Add more specific usage instructions here.**]

For example:
*   If it's a web app: "After running the command, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`."
*   If it's a command-line tool: "You can provide arguments to the script like so: `python app.py --input 'path/to/data.csv' --output 'results.json'`."
*   Explain what the expected output is.
